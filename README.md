# Perfect-Pair

This is my first major JavaScript project. Perfect pair is an e-commerce site where you can select the shoes you like and add to your cart. 
The main aim of the project was to demonstrate how to work with the local storage. I had help creating the hamburger...Overall, it is a beautiful project.
